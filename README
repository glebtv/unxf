= UnXF - Un-X-Forward* the Rack environment

Rack middleware to remove "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR" in the Rack environment and
replace "REMOTE_ADDR" with the value of the original client address.

This uses the "rpatricia" RubyGem to filter out spoofed requests from
clients outside your LAN.  The list of trusted address defaults to
private LAN addresses defined RFC 1918 and those belonging to localhost.

This will also read "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO" and set "rack.url_scheme"
to "https" if the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header is set properly and sent
from a trusted address chain.

== Install

If you use RubyGems:

    gem install unxf

You will need a C compiler and Ruby development headers to install the
"rpatricia" RubyGem if it is not already installed.

=== Hacking

You can get the latest source via git from the following locations:

* git clone git://bogomips.org/unxf.git
* git clone git://repo.or.cz/unxf.git (mirror)

You may browse the code from the web and download the latest snapshot
tarballs here:

* http://bogomips.org/unxf.git (cgit)
* http://repo.or.cz/w/unxf.git (gitweb)

Inline patches (from "git format-patch") to the
{mailing list}[mailto:unxf@librelist.org] are
preferred because they allow code review and comments in the reply to
the patch.

We will adhere to mostly the same conventions for patch submissions as
git itself.  See the Documentation/SubmittingPatches document
distributed with git on on patch submission guidelines to follow.  Just
don't email the git mailing list or maintainer with unxf patches.

== Contact

All feedback (bug reports, user/development discussion, patches, pull
requests) go to the mailing list: mailto:unxf@librelist.org
